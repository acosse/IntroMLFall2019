To prune the sentence we will use two lists. The first one from the corpus module of nltk and the second one from the second one (encoding the punctuation) from the string module. To prune the lines (or documents), remove all the words that appear in the lists 'stopwords.words('english')' or 'string.punctuation'. \n",

In the loop, you should therefore add a line that for each word in the current list of words extracted from the current line in the file, either adds that word to the dictionnary with 1 as its occurence, or add 1 to the previous number of occurence for that word if the word already belongs to the dictionnary.\n",
